<u>Objective:</u> 

The objective of the project was to create an autonomous ground vehicle that has the capability of travelling to predetermined locations via GPS with an attached target system. The overall task of the rover is to move to a certain location, raise a target, wait for the target to be hit, lower the target once hit, and then move onto the next predetermined location.

<u>Summary:</u> 

In todayâ€™s growing technological world, humans strive towards efficiency and saving time. For soldiers across the world, they spend countless hours practicing their aim, improving their accuracy, and shooting at targets to prepare for any real-life scenarios. The application of this rover would be used in military applications and for gun enthusiasts.

It is crucial that soldiers are able to practice as much as they can to perform at the highest level in order to succeed in any task. Despite this fact, soldiers can only practice at stationary targets, which limits their time. We have created an autonomous target scoring rover that will revolutionize the way target practice will be conducted. By building a robust rover with the capability of autonomously moving to different longitude and latitude coordinates via GPS and by attaching a raiseable  target with hit detection, soldiers and gun enthusiasts alike will now be able to efficiently save time and perform target practice. With the ease of choosing their desired location and without moving from their shooting spot, the user will have more time to line up shots and improve their skills.

Our overall objective for this project was to create an autonomous ground vehicle that has the capability of travelling to predetermined locations via GPS with an attached target system. The overall task of the rover is to move to a certain location, raise a target, wait for the target to be hit, lower the target once hit, and then move onto the next predetermined location.

Our design objectives for this project includes a robust aluminum chassis.  The key components would be mounted onto a lightweight, high strength aluminum alloy chassis makes it both extremely solid and durable.  The rover includes two tank style tracks that are made of an engineering plastic which is good for both dampening and traction. The motor also uses two 12V low noise 350 RPM DC motors. These motors provide both powerful torque and efficient power consumption. We designed the rover to control these motors using a 2WD PWM tank style set up.

Key features for the rover this project include GPS navigation using a four-coordinate longitude and latitude system,  GUI user input to manually input select coordinates, and a compass for accurate calculation of heading, bearing, and for the target to always face the origin.  The rover also has an object avoidance feature to not hit objects on
 the way to its destination.

Our design goals for GPS would be a 0-6m accuracy within the actual longitude and latitude. During testing, we achieved 0-10m accuracy with an error of 0.67. Our goal for angle bearing accuracy with the compass was 0-6 degrees with the result being more accurate at 0-3 degrees. For power, we decided to go with an 11.1V 2200mAh LiPo battery.
